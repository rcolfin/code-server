# code-server

This repo builds upon the [docker-code-server](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-code-server) image, then installs dependencies required for other development environments such as Python.

The base image is [linuxserver/code-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/code-server), and will publish to [rcolfin/metelsoft:code-server](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rcolfin/metelsoft/code-server)
